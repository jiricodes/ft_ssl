# Libft

Project given by Hive Helsinki.

>**Final Grade 100/100**
>
>**Bonus Grade  22/25**

Currently includes also files of get_next_line and ft_printf projects.

The goal of this project was to create our own library containing
useful functions which should be then reused through the first year of 42 curriculum.

Only allowed libc functions were `malloc(3)`, `free(3)` and `write(2)`
